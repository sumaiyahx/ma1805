0.1 Drawing- I have nevr coded before therefre I will say I did quite struugle with this but 
watching tutoriols helped make it easier. My skills are very much beginner level and I did 
therefore use some of the help VS Code did also povide. For this prompt, I created a blue emoji 
with pink eyes and mouth and then with a lighterpink tounge. I had to ask for some assitsnace in order
to get the features on the actual circle itself as thar I did struggle with. 
Overal I found this prompt to be much eassier than the others.

0.2 Movement- For this prompt I used my code that I did in 0.1 Deawing as I found it harder to create 
something entirely else. I added a trainge to the emoji to show I can use other shapes with coding. At first 
when I ran it with Live Server it was not woeking but I managed to fix that issue as I realised one of my brackets 
were red and the codes needed t be closed inside. I feel as if I am now getting used to the idea of how to
code as I am now understanding wat to add and what to fix myseelf
